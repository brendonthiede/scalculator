# Scalculator

This is a calculator for determining the resource impact of different scaling decisions for various Kubernetes resources. Depending on the type of resource selected, the user will be presented with different input fields to enter the relevant parameters. For KEDA ScaledJob, the inputs will be maxReplicaCount, minReplicaCount, parallelism, requested memory, requested CPU, and max memory. For KEDA ScaledObject, the inputs will be maxReplicaCount, minReplicaCount, requested memory, requested CPU, and max memory. For Deployment, there should be a toggle for whether it has an HPA associated with it, and if it does the inputs will be maxReplicaCount, minReplicaCount, requested memory, requested CPU, and max memory, but if it doesn't it will use replicas, requested memory, requested CPU, and max memory. For StatefulSet, the inputs will be replicas, requested memory, requested CPU, and max memory. There should always be a selector for the instance type that the workload will be scheduled onto, and the options will be from a list that will be manually updated so that the later calculations can take into consideration the number of cores and memory available on the instance type.

Scalculator should be a simple static web page using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Based on the selected resource type, the page will display the relevant input fields. The user can enter the values and as they're updating the totals should try to automatically update, assuming the inputs are valid numbers and not causing division by 0. The calculated values should be for minimum number of pods, maximum number of pods, minimum memory (total for all pods), maximum memory (total for all pods), minimum CPU (total for all pods), maximum CPU (total for all pods), and then the number of instances that would be required to run the workload based on the instance type selected. The calculations should be done in JavaScript and the results should be displayed on the page. The page should be responsive and work well on mobile devices. The code should be clean and well-organized, with comments explaining the different sections. The page should also have a simple design with a header, footer, and a main content area. The header should contain the title of the page and a brief description of what it does. The footer should contain links to any relevant resources or documentation.

Scalculator should also have unit tests using Jest to ensure that the calculations are correct. The tests should cover all the different resource types and edge cases, such as invalid inputs or division by 0. The tests should be run automatically as part of the build process to ensure that any changes to the code do not break the functionality. The tests should also be well-organized and easy to understand, with clear descriptions of what each test is checking. The code should be written in a way that makes it easy to add new features or modify existing ones in the future.

The code should be modular and follow best practices for JavaScript development. The page should also be accessible and follow web standards to ensure that it works well on all browsers and devices. The design should be simple and clean, with a focus on usability and readability. The page should also be optimized for performance, with minimal loading times and efficient use of resources. The code should be well-documented and easy to understand, with clear explanations of how the different parts of the code work together. The page should also have a simple design with a header, footer, and a main content area. The header should contain the title of the page and a brief description of what it does. The footer should contain links to any relevant resources or documentation.
